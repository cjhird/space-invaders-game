Workflow:

1. Create GitHub repo (on personal github) and link it to local file

2. Create the plan + write pseudocode 

3. Wireframe the game 

4. Create the game colour scheme and design pattern

5. Find/download the resources (images, sounds)

7. Start writing code! - build MVP first
    1. html
    2. basic css (enough for functionality)
    3. javascript - dom manipulation

8. After MVP works - Improve/enhance with additional features
    1. views - start / loading / gameover screens
