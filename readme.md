SPACE INVADERS

Overview
Space Invaders is a simple grid-based game in which you as the shooter have to shoot down as many alien invaders before they get to you. We are going to build a 15 x 15 grid square with 20 invaders to shoot.

My Workflow:
1. Create GitHub repo (on personal github) and link it to local file

2. Create the plan + write pseudocode 

3. Wireframe the game 

4. Create the game colour scheme and design pattern

5. Find/download the resources (images, sounds)
  https://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/graphics

7. Start writing code! - build MVP first
    1. html
    2. basic css (enough for functionality)
    3. javascript - dom manipulation

8. After MVP works - Improve/enhance with additional features
    1. views - start / loading / gameover screens

9. After coding is complete - Host project on GitHub pages
